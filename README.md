[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/covidsafe/App-Android.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/covidsafe/App-Android)

CovidSafe is a tool built by doctors and researchers at the University of Washington with Microsoft volunteers to alert you about highly relevant public health announcements, exposure to COVID-19, and to assist contact tracing without compromising your personal privacy.

Here is an [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHqM-dj3hM4) (2:01) of our app.

CovidSafe has the following features:
* You are notified of potential exposures to other users who have been positively identified with COVID-19. This is achieved with a privacy-preserving Bluetooth protocol. [Live demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CKtu6zpkNs) (0:56)
* You can receive public service announcements sent by health care officials to your neighborhood
* Public health officials can send messages to individual neighborhoods using Google Forms [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdu5YkUmRB8) (0:47). For more details for how to do this, check out this [repo](https://github.com/covidsafe/hcp-tools)
* You can log **symptoms** with our symptom tracker, your **location** with our private location log and **contacts** you have been around with recently. These logs are useful for aggregating information for interviews with public health officials and contact tracers
* You can import any past location history associated with your Google account

To run an end-to-end demo of the app on your own phone, please refer to [**these instructions**](https://github.com/covidsafe/App-Android/wiki/Running-the-app) in our wiki.

Our tool is built upon the following white paper:<br/>
**PACT: Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing<br/>**

**There are many more exciting additions that we wish to add to this repo and in other repos that are detailed in the issue trackers. We are looking for people to contribute to this project, please look through the list of issues, and if you find one you want to work on specifically, email me (jucha@cs.washington.edu) and I can add you as a member of the Slack and Github org. I am also more than happy to walk you through the details of the current codebase so we can figure out how best to integrate your chosen feature.**
